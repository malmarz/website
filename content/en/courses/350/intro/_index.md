We will cover a number of prerequisites for the course before we dive into web application development. Specifically, we will need to cover the following topics:

0. [Introduction to the development environment]()
1. [Quick Python review, including Object Oriented]({{< ref "python.md" >}}) Programming and some useful Python features.
2. [Remote collaboration]({{< ref "collab.md" >}}) on software projects.
3. [Project management]({{< ref "proj-mgt.md" >}}) for team based projects.
4. [Overview of web applications]({{< ref "webapplications.md" >}}).
5. [Overview of the Django development process]({{< ref "dev-process.md" >}}).

Following this introduction, we can start with our first project for this course where you will create [Blog web application]({{< ref "blog-project" >}}).

## Exercises and Assignments

As we progress this course we will work together on the Blog project and learn something new about Django every week and improve the project. You are expected to get familiar with django by complete the steps in the Blog project prior to each class. **Reading the Django documentation related to each step is a must**.

**Following each week**, you will also be assigned to work on specific requirements for the Poll project. You are expected to work on this project on your own and apply what you learned from the previous week.

**In the second half of the semester**, you will be required to work on your final project as a group and utilize the tools for remote team collaboration and project management.
