Every couple of weeks, I will specify some requirements that you need to complete before the due date and submit through GitHub.

## ER-Diagram

The ER-Diagram describes the data requirements and will be used for constructing the project's data models in models.py. The blog data model is currently very simple and contains a single entity:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Poll ||--o{ Option : Has
    Option || --o{ Response : Has

    Poll {
        string title
        string question
        datetime active_until
        int status 
    }
    
    Option {
        string title
    }

    Response {
        string name
        datetime response_time
    }
```
