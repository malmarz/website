# Project Options
This is a project-based course, and you are required to complete a project. You have two options to choose from:

1. **Choose Your Own Project**
2. **Work on the E-Commerce Project** (described below)

## Option 1: Choose Your Own Project

If you prefer, you can propose your own project. This option allows you to explore a topic that interests you and encourages deeper learning. To proceed with this option:

- Submit a proposal that describes your project and includes detailed requirements.
- Present your proposal to me after class or during office hours for approval.
- **Approval Deadline:** Teams must receive approval by **April 7th**. If approval is not obtained by this date, you will be required to work on the e-commerce project.

## Option 2: E-Commerce Project

For this option, you will work on building an e-commerce platform based on the following client requirements:

> "We need an e-commerce platform to display our products and allow users to search and purchase items. Products will have categories, descriptions, serial numbers, prices, and quantities in stock. It would be ideal to include product images and basic inventory management.
>
> The platform should also manage customer information, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers. Additionally, we need CRM features to track purchase history and calculate customer profitability scores.
>
> To promote sales, customers should be able to leave reviews, read reviews, and see which products are the most popular in each category."

### Steps for the E-Commerce Project
1. Use the client description to create an **ER Diagram** for your project.
2. Define project requirements as tickets in a ticketing system or as a list in the `ReadMe.md` file.
3. Implement the system based on the requirements, updating tickets as you refine the project.
4. Leave incomplete tickets in the system to show your thought process and planning.

## Requirements for Both Options

- **Team Registration:** [Sign up your team here](https://classroom.github.com/a/8FJizrQU).
- **Team Roles:** Assign a project manager and list all team members in the `ReadMe.md` file. Clearly indicate who the project manager is.
- **Documentation:**
  - For **Option 1**, describe the complete project requirements in the `ReadMe.md` file.
  - For **Option 2**, clearly state that you are working on the e-commerce project and give your project a unique name that reflects the business or product.
- **Project Management:**
  - Create an **ER Diagram** to define the information requirements. Use [ERD Plus](https://erdplus.com/) and include the diagram in the `ReadMe.md` file.
  - Define project requirements in one of two ways:
    1. Write them in the `ReadMe.md` file as a list of specific tasks (similar to the Poll Project assignment).
    2. **Optional (Bonus):** Use a ticketing system (e.g., [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues), [Trello](https://trello.com/guide), or [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/introduction#what-is-jira-software)) to manage tasks. This requires learning agile project management techniques.
- **Demonstration:** Bring a PC to class to demonstrate your project.
- **Go Beyond Requirements:** Add extra features to make your application more valuable. Use your time wisely to learn new Django features and improve your project.

## Grading Criteria

### 1. Demonstration (30%)
Each team will have 10 minutes to present their project. During the demo, you should:
1. Introduce team members and provide an overview of the project.
2. Demonstrate key features of the application, focusing on its functionality and design.
3. Answer questions about the application, including technical and business-related aspects.

Evaluation will be based on:
- Effective use of time
- Quality of the presentation
- How well the application meets the requirements
- Preparation (e.g., test data, planned demo flow)
- Ability to answer questions
- Application functionality

### 2. Design (10%)
Design will be evaluated based on:
- The quality and appropriateness of the ER Diagram
- The clarity and completeness of the requirements
- How well the project meets the clientâ€™s stated needs

### 3. Collaboration (30%)
Collaboration will be assessed based on:
- Team involvement in development and project management
- Proper use of GitHub for collaboration, including:
  - Pull requests
  - Ticketing systems
  - Clear communication and guidelines in the `ReadMe.md` file

### 4. Individual Contribution (30%)
Individual contributions will be evaluated based on:
1. The amount of work completed by each team member (tracked via GitHub)
2. Peer evaluations

### 5. Code Review
The instructor will perform a final code review to:
1. Verify that the work was completed by the team without external assistance.
2. Ensure the application functions as expected.
3. Evaluate bonus features. Bonus items must be listed in a **Bonus Items** section in the `ReadMe.md` file, with references to the file and line numbers where they are implemented. **Failure to follow this instruction will result in no bonus points being awarded.**

For bonus ideas, refer to the [Advanced Django Section]({{< ref "django-advanced" >}}).
