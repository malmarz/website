## Requirements

While there are many ways to use python, development can be done locally or in the cloud. I will recommend the use of local development for this course. To setup for this course, you will be required to perform the following:

- Install [anacoda python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Instructions on how to setup VS code for python development can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

## Course Content
Slides for this session can be found [here]({{< ref "slides/pyintro" >}}).
